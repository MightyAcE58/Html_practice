        <p>Jujutsu Kaisen (呪術廻戦, "Sorcery Fight") is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Gege Akutami. It has been serialized in Shueisha's shōnen manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump since March 2018, with its chapters collected and published in 24 tankōbon volumes as of October 2023. The story follows high school student Yuji Itadori as he joins a secret organization of Jujutsu Sorcerers to eliminate a powerful Curse named Ryomen Sukuna, of whom Yuji becomes the host. Jujutsu Kaisen is a sequel to Akutami's Tokyo Metropolitan Curse Technical School, serialized in Shueisha's Jump Giga from April to July 2017, later collected in a tankōbon volume, retroactively titled as Jujutsu Kaisen 0, in December 2018.

            Jujutsu Kaisen is licensed for English-language release in North America by Viz Media, which has published the manga in print since December 2019. Shueisha publishes the series in English on the Manga Plus online platform. Two novels, written by Ballad Kitaguni, were published in May 2019 and January 2020, respectively. A 24-episode anime television series adaptation produced by MAPPA, aired on MBS from October 2020 to March 2021; a second season premiered in July 2023. The anime is licensed by Crunchyroll for streaming outside of Asia, which premiered an English dub in November 2020. The anime's original soundtrack was released in April 2021.
    
            By July 2023, the Jujutsu Kaisen manga had over 80 million copies in circulation, including related novels, digital versions, and Jujutsu Kaisen 0, making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time.<img src="https://www.pngmart.com/files/23/Jujutsu-Kaisen-Logo-PNG-Photos.png" alt="Jujutsu_kaisen"></p>

           <h1> Synopsis</h1></br>
    <h2> Setting</h2></br>
In Jujutsu Kaisen, all living beings emanate energy called Cursed Energy (呪力, Juryoku), which arises from negative emotions that naturally flow throughout the body. Ordinary people cannot control this flow in their bodies. As a result, they continually lose Cursed Energy, resulting in the birth of Curses (呪い, Noroi), a race of spiritual beings whose primary desire is to bring harm to humanity. These Curses are shown as gruesome monsters, ghosts, and yōkai.

Jujutsu Sorcerers (呪術師, Jujutsushi, lit. "Cursed Technique Masters" or "Shamans") are people who control the flow of Cursed Energy in their bodies, allowing them to use it as they please and also to reduce its release. High-ranking Sorcerers and Curses can refine this energy and use it to perform Cursed Techniques (呪術式, Jujutsushiki), which tend to be unique to the user or their family. An advanced form of Cursed Technique is Domain Expansion (領域展開, Ryōiki Tenkai), which the users build a pocket dimension of variable size. Inside the domain, all of their attacks will always connect and grow in strength.

           <h1> Production</h1>
In 2017, Gege Akutami published Tokyo Metropolitan Curse Technical School, a 4-chapter series that ran in Jump Giga from April 28 to July 28.[3][4] This series would serve later as a prequel to Jujutsu Kaisen, being retroactively titled as Jujutsu Kaisen 0.[5] According to Hiroyuki Nakano, the chief editor of Weekly Shōnen Jump, Jujutsu Kaisen received unanimous approval in the serialization committee.[6] It debuted in Weekly Shōnen Jump on March 5, 2018.[7]

Akutami stated that Neon Genesis Evangelion influenced the mythological aspects of the series,[8] being also influenced by horror and found footage films.[9] Akutami is particularly a fan of Yoshihiro Togashi, author of YuYu Hakusho and Hunter × Hunter,[9][10] expressing intentions to have an art style as close as possible to his.[8] The author is also a fan of Tite Kubo, author of Bleach, and discussed in an interview with him the similarities between their works.[11][12] Other manga artists who influenced Akutami include Masashi Kishimoto (Naruto) and Yusuke Murata (Eyeshield 21 and One-Punch Man illustrator).[8] The magic system of Jujutsu Kaisen is largely based on Hunter × Hunter, whose fights, in Akutami's words, "rejects emotional arguments", stating, however, that like Daisuke Ashihara, World Trigger's author, whose magic system is also similar to Togashi's series, Akutami is trying to find and develop their own style.[9] In particular, Akutami believes the first chapter was a mix of Bleach and Naruto. Akutami regrets some elements of the first chapter, due to the short appearance of Yuji's grandfather within the story.[13]

In October 2020, Akutami stated that the story's ending and main stages are planned, but that the path between the two remains "fairly free."[8] In February 2021, Akutami stated that the series would probably be finished within two years, declaring, however, no confidence in that statement. Akutami knows how the story for Megumi Fushiguro will end, but not for Sukuna.[14] On June 9, 2021, it was announced that the manga would enter on hiatus due to the author's health issues;[15][16] it resumed publication on August 2 of the same year.[17][18] In December 2022, Akutami hinted that the manga would end within a year, stating during the Jump Festa '23 event: "If you accompany me for up to one more year (probably), I will be very happy."[19]
