                <h3>Treatment for delusional disorder often includes therapy. </br>Medication may also be used to help manage symptoms in some cases.</h3>
                
                    Delusional disorder is a mental health condition defined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition, text revision (DSM-5-TR), as the presence of delusions lasting 1 month or longer.

The condition’s primary symptom is delusions — enduring, unrealistic thoughts, ideas, and beliefs that remain despite evidence they’re untrue.

While hallucinations may rarely be present in delusional disorder, the DSM-5-TR notes they aren’t as significant and will follow the theme of delusions.

Treatment for this condition typically involves a combination of therapy, medication, and self-care strategies.
                
            </p>

            <p>
           <u> <h3 >Psychotherapy</h3></u>
            Delusional disorder treatment can be challenging. Many people living with this condition aren’t able to recognize the inaccuracy of their thoughts or the need for help.

“Delusional disorders are ego-syntonic, meaning the person doesn’t believe they’re sick so are unlikely to seek treatment on their own,” explains Dr. Laurence Miller, a licensed clinical and forensic psychologist from Boca Raton, Florida.

According to a 2015 reviewTrusted Source, there’s not enough research to make an evidence-based recommendation for treatment for delusional disorder.

“When available, effective treatment usually involves a combination of medication and cognitive behavioral psychotherapy,” Miller says.

    <u> <h3>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) </h3></u>
    CBT is considered one of the foundational approaches to delusional disorder treatment.

It’s a methodology that centers around three core principles:

unhelpful ways of thinking are a part of the core of psychological challenges
learned, unhelpful behaviors directly contribute to psychological challenges
symptoms can be effectively managed through the development of better coping strategies
So, CBT focuses on recognizing unhelpful thoughts and behaviors and their consequences.

With this understanding, you can progress through CBT by developing problem-solving skills and a sense of confidence in your decisions.

        <h3>Cognitive behavioral therapy for psychosis (CBTp)</h3>
    </u>
    Treatment of psychosis symptoms such as delusions may involve a targeted process of CBT known as CBTp.

CBTp incorporates the same principles as CBT but focuses on ways to live with delusions, aiming to reduce symptoms of distress and improve overall functioning. It’s a therapeutic approach that involves reducing the stigma surrounding psychosis.

    Cognitive behavioral worry intervention (W-CBT)
Research from 2009 suggests another form of CBT, cognitive behavioral worry intervention (W-CBT), may hold some benefit for addressing the anxiety that can accompany delusions.

<p>
    <u>
        <h3>Medications</h3>
    </u>
    There’s no medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat delusional disorder. But medication may be suggested in some cases to help address imbalances in neurotransmitters thought to contribute to symptoms.
